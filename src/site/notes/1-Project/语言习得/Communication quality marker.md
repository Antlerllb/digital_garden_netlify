# 1 To capture
- the overall quality in communication
- the intensity of each of the language disorders
# 2 Calculation
- label: {anomia, disfluency, agrammatism, fluent}
- averaged probabilities over the entire session i.e., p($y_i^L$ | $y_i$ = fluent)
- similarly construct anomia, disfluency, and agrammatism markers (see Appx. D), and compare their changes across cohorts as above.
