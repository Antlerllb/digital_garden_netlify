# 1 Abstraction
- Contribution
	- accessible from source to digital analysis
- Loss
	- there is always a loss of information involved
- Different applications may require different levels of abstraction
	- spoken language: retain filler words or pauses
	- handwritten language transcription: orthographic errors
# 2 Situation
- Spelling errors is not necessary and may even hamper the analyses (Grabowski et al., 2014)
	- analyzed for vocabulary, thematic coherence, or reader-orientedness
- Normalization ❌
	- analyzed for handwriting, assessing orthographic competence
# 3 Retaining orthographic features
- Contribution
	- additional information beyond the actual text about the writing process and the writer’s skills.
- Orthographic features
	- spelling errors
	- capitalization errors
	- punctuation errors
	- impurities: strikethroughs, inserts, and smudges.
	- …

# 4 Case
See for example Figure 1, where two letters are written on top of each other (‘S’ and ‘s’, where Schuler ‘student’ with a capital ‘S’ would be the correct spelling).

This may be a self-correction or the writer was unsure about the correct form and provided both simultaneously. It may be viewed as an error in the context of assessing spelling competence or normalized for the purpose of analyzing a learner’s vocabulary. Once the transcriber decided for a variant, information about the uncertainty is lost.
# 5 Transcription Guidelines
- the transcription reflects exactly what is written by the learner – i.e. **orthography is not corrected** – and where
- **reconcile** what the child **has written or intended to write** with what a machine transcription would read
- prioritize preserving the integrity of the **original text** and capturing the **nuances of the learner’s writing style**
