**Recent studies** (e.g., Linzen et al., 2016; Marvin and Linzen, 2018; Wilcox et al., 2018) **have explored this question by** evaluating LMs’ preferences between minimal pairs of sentences differing in grammatical acceptability, as in Example 1.
**However, each of these studies** uses a different set of metrics, and **focuses on** a small set of linguistic paradigms, **severely limiting any possible** big-picture conclusions.
