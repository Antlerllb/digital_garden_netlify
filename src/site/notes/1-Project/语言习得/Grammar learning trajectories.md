## 1.2 CLAM (the L1 side)
- TNM-drop: L1 pretraining and bilingual training
- L1-only: L1 pretraining and further training on L1 texts collected from the parallel corpus

# 2 Text analysis
对上方图的文本分析，比较全面，但没什么新意
- L1→L2 effects
	- General improvement after dozens of epochs
	- Differences in grammar items
	- Inter-L1s differences
- L2→L1 effects
	- L2 effects once occur, but diminish
	- L2 negatively affects L1 knowledge
# 3 Table
| Notation | Desc |
| ---- | ---- |
| OVERALL | macro-average accuracy over all linguistic phenomena |
| The rows with ✓ | accuracy of bilingual LMs on BLiMP |
| The rows with ∆ | performance difference between the LMs with and without L1 pretraining |
