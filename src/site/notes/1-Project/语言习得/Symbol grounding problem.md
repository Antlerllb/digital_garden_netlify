## 0.1 Dictionary -> Merry-go-round
**Suppose you had to learn Chinese as a second language** and the only source of information you had was a Chinese/Chinese dictionary.
The trip through the dictionary would amount to a merry-go-round, passing endlessly from one meaningless symbol or symbol-string (the definiens) to another (the definiendum), never coming to a halt on what anything meant.
## 0.2 Get off the symbol merry-go-round
How can you ever get off the symbol/symbol merry-goround? How is symbol meaning to be grounded in something other than just more meaningless symbols? **This is the symbol grounding problem**
## 0.3 Connecting to the world
If each definiens in a Chinese/Chinese dictionary were somehow connected to the world in the right way, we would hardly need the definienda!
