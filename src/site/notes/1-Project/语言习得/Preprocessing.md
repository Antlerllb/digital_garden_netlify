# 1 Abstraction
- Contribution
	- accessible from source to digital analysis
- Loss
	- information
- In transcription: normalization
	- spoken language: retain filler words or pauses
	- handwritten language: orthographic features
## 1.1 Retaining orthographic features
- Orthographic features
	- spelling errors
	- capitalization errors
	- punctuation errors
	- impurities: strikethroughs, inserts, and smudges.
- Contribution
	- additional information beyond the actual text about the writing process and the writer’s skills.
## 1.2 Case
- Normalization ✔
	- Purpose: vocabulary, thematic coherence, or reader-orientedness
	- inserted pieces of text should be transcribed where the writer intended them to appear
- Normalization ❌
	- Purpose: handwriting, assess orthographic competence
	- the inserts have to be transcribed at the position where they were written in the text.
