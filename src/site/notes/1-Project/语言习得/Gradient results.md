# 1 Native speakers
 #native-speaker
- Native speakers’ acceptability judgments interact with other cognitive and perceptual systems and generally produce **gradient results**.
- Example: longer and more complex sentences, even when fully grammatical, are rated as less acceptable than shorter and simpler sentences.
- 渐进性的结果，不是二元的。
- 某种表达可能被认为更自然、更流畅，而另一种表达可能稍显不自然、有些别扭，而不一定是完全接受或完全拒绝。这种渐进性反映了母语使用者对语言表达的细微感知和理解。
# 2 Magnitude Estimation vs Forced Choice
- Magnitude Estimation #gap 
	- make comparisons within and across minimal pairs
	- thereby treating sentence acceptability as a gradient measure
- Forced Choice
	- treats sentence acceptability as functionally categorical: only acceptable or not relative to its minimal pair counterpart
