# 1 LLM
- be prone to
	- perpetuating and, in some cases, exacerbating social prejudices (Blodgett et al., 2020)
	- propagate and amplify negative stereotypes of marginalized groups
- reason
	- pretrained on large corpora of text largely scraped from the web
		- These biases may surface in downstream applications, such as machine translation (Stanovsky et al., 2019) and sentiment analysis (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2018).
# 2 Speaking bias
- Human rater bias
	- influenced unconsciously by peripheral cues (speakers’ accents) (Kang and Yaw, 2021)
	- more lenient towards examinees who share the same L1 background
	- implicit bias: gender vocal cues
- Socio-cultural factors
- Curricular differences
- Item difficulty
	- related to guessing behavior
	- able to guess their way through non-speaking items, yet struggle with speaking items
