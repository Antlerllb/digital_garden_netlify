# 1 Recent momentum
[[5-Attachment/ZoteroNote/@L2friendlyPipelines_2023_Sung\|@L2friendlyPipelines_2023_Sung]]
- Automatic processing: is gaining momentum for a better understanding of the properties of learner language (e.g., Bestgen and Granger, 2014; Kyle and Crossley, 2017; Lu, 2010).
# 2 Major caveats
[[5-Attachment/ZoteroNote/@L2friendlyPipelines_2023_Sung\|@L2friendlyPipelines_2023_Sung]]
- sampling bias (diversity, equity, inclusion, generalizability)
	- inclusion: 包容性
	- generalizability: the generalizability of previous findings to other (and lesser-studied) languages
	- towards dominant/hegemonic viewpoints and discourse
	- centering around a limited range of languages and language-usage contexts
	- (c.f., Bender et al., 2021)
- L1-based automatic processing pipelines work for L2 data
