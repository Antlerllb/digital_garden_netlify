In the 2023 Wimbledon Gentlemen’s final, 20-year-old Carlos Alcaraz secured a historic victory by defeating 36-year-old Novak Djokovic. Djokovic, a Wimbledon stalwart, experienced his first defeat since 2013, marking the end of an era. The match unfolded dramatically, with Djokovic initially dominating but Alcaraz making a comeback to win the second and third sets decisively. Despite Djokovic's resurgence in the fourth set, Alcaraz ultimately clinched the victory in the fifth set.
