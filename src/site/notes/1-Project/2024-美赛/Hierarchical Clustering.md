Hierarchical clustering involves measuring the similarity (or dissimilarity) between pairs of rows and columns and forming a hierarchical tree-like structure, known as a dendrogram. The process starts by computing a correlation distance between each pair of rows and columns. These distances are then used to build a hierarchical tree, where similar rows or columns are joined together based on the average linkage.
