Z-Score normalization, also known as standardization, is a statistical technique used to transform the features of a dataset into a standard normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 0 and a standard deviation (σ) of 1.

This standardized representation of features is particularly beneficial when training machine learning models, as it helps prevent the model from being skewed by features with larger magnitudes. Ultimately, Z-Score normalization contributes to a more robust and accurate understanding of the patterns and dynamics within tennis match data.
