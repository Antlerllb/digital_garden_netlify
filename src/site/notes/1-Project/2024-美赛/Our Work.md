In this paper, we input Multiagent Timesteps data into the Bi-LSTM Model and the ELO Ratings Algorithm, allowing us to calculate Momentum and ELO Ratings. Subsequently, we generalize the predictive model using the Attacker-defender Dribble Model and apply it to basketball, football, table tennis, and tennis.
