In this problem, we are given data for every point from all Wimbledon 2023 men's matches after the first two rounds. The option to incorporate additional player information or supplementary data is available, subject to proper documentation of sources.
We will solve the following problems based on the match data:
1. Develop a model to analyze the dynamic progression of play during tennis matches, specifically identifying the player with superior performance at any given point and quantifying the performance difference.
2. A tennis coach is skeptical that “momentum” plays any role in the match. Instead, he postulates that swings in play and runs of success by one player are random. Use a model/metric to assess this claim.
3. Develop a predictive model using the provided data to identify indicators of impending shifts in the flow of play between players during a tennis match. Determine the factors most strongly associated with these changes. Additionally, based on historical momentum differentials, provide advice on match preparation for a player facing a new opponent.
4. Test the model on other matches to evaluate its predictive accuracy for match swings. Identify factors for potential model improvement if performance is suboptimal. Assess the generalizability of the model across various contexts, including different matches, tournaments, court surfaces, and sports like table tennis.
5. Produce a report of no more than 25 pages with your findings and include a oneto two-page memo summarizing your results with advice for coaches on the role of “momentum,” and how to prepare players to respond to events that impact the flow of play during a tennis match.
