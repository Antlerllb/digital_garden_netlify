# 1 Model Generalization: Shared Momentum in Multiagent Ball Games
## 1.1 Three Dimensional Kinematics: Spherical Object and Instantaneous Actions
In this section, we focus on the generalization of the momentum concept across various ball games, namely basketball, football, and table tennis. The data collection process involves obtaining datasets from different games, each offering unique insights into player dynamics and game characteristics.

Table: Multiagent Ball Games Dataset Overview

| Ball Game | Dataset | Content（用无序列表） |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Basketball | NBA[^2] | Player metrics data, Performance statistics, Physical activity records |
| Football | San Jose (SJ) Earthquakes[^1] | (x, y)-player position data, Log of all 1v1 situations |
| Table Tennis | OSAI[^3] | Players' potential features, In-match statistics |
