We examine the robustness of our momentum prediction model, observing how it varies with the model parameter β. It is important to note that this property remains consistent, independent of the parameter φφ, particularly when φφ is sufficiently small. The parameter φφ significantly influences both the fidelity and the control time of the predictive process. Through analytical computations, we unveil that the control time exhibits a logarithmic divergence as φφ approaches zero (refer to Supplementary Section II).
