We examine the robustness of our momentum prediction model, observing how it varies with the dataset size and the court surface. Our model demonstrates robustness to various external parameters, such as court surfaces like Hard Court and Grass Court. Additionally, our model exhibits a high sensitivity to dataset size, showing that its performance benefits significantly from larger datasets. The reason behind this is that a larger dataset allows the model to capture more diverse patterns, improving its generalization and overall effectiveness.
