Algorithm 1: Simulation of the Asian giant hornet propagation Input: Due time Ttotal, number of the initial population N0 and corresponding coordinates (x0, y0), growth rate r, resource dependence coefficient γ. Output: Population number Nt and its corresponding coordinates (xt, yt). 1 Initialize the set of cells C and the set of nests N0 based on N0 and (x0, y0); 2 for t = 0 to Ttotal − 1 do 3 for i ∈ Nt do 4 Calculate Ci and Ei based on Equations (1) and (2); 5 Randomly select Qi based on Equation (5); 6 Calculate Pij for each j ∈ C based on Equation (6); 7 Set Pi = (Pij)|C|×1 for all j ∈ C; 8 for x = 0 to Qi do 9 Selecting a destination j based on the probability vector Pi; 10 Add j into Nt+1; 11 end 12 end 13 return Nt+1 and its corresponding coordinates (xt+1, yt+1); 14 end
