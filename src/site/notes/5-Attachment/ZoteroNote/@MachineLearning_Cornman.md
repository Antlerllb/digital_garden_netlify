## Abstract
Our project had two main objectives. First, we wanted to use historical tennis match data to predict the outcomes of future tennis matches. Next, we wanted to use the predictions from our resulting model to beat the current betting odds. After setting up our prediction and betting models, we were able to accurately predict the outcome of 69.6% of the 2016 and 2017 tennis season, and turn a 3.3% proÔ¨Åt per match.
