## Abstract
Although adverse environmental exposures are considered a major cause of chronic diseases, current studies provide limited information on real-world chemical exposures and related risks. For this study, we collected serum samples from 5696 healthy people and patients, including those with 12 chronic diseases, in China and completed serum biomonitoring including 267 chemicals via gas and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Seventy-four highly frequently detected exposures were used for exposure characterization and risk analysis. The results show that region is the most critical factor influencing human exposure levels, followed by age. Organochlorine pesticides and perfluoroalkyl substances are associated with multiple chronic diseases, and some of them exceed safe ranges. Multi-exposure models reveal significant risk effects of exposure on hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive human serum exposome atlas and disease risk information, which can guide subsequent in-depth cause-and-effect studies between environmental exposures and human health.
