## Abstract
We propose an augmented reality (AR)-based training system for basketball free-throws. The optimal shot trajectory for free-throws is projected by a head-mounted display according to the shooterâ€™s release point. The efficacy of the training system was assessed in novice shooters by comparing changes in success rates and eye-gaze behavior (quiet eye [QE]) between AR-training and control-training groups. The success rate during the AR training with the optimal trajectory did not differ from the pre-training rate; however, in post-AR training, i.e., after removal of the optimal trajectory, the success rate increased. Additionally, AR training increased the QE duration (QED) compared with that recorded during pre- and post-training blocks. In contrast, the control group showed no change in the success rate or QED. These findings imply that our AR training system affected QE behavior and improved free-throwing shooting performance after training. Thus, our system is expected to enhance basketball free-throw shooting performance.
