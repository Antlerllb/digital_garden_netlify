## 1.2 Abstract
Machine learning, classiﬁcation and prediction models have applications across a range of ﬁelds. Sport analytics is one such increasingly popular ﬁeld, but most existing work focuses on automated refereeing and injury prevention in mainstream sports. Research on other sports, such as table tennis, have only recently started gaining more traction. In this paper, I aim to predict the outcome of table tennis matches, by evaluating a range of existing supervised machine learning models to ﬁnd a reliable predictor, trained on historical player and match statistics. I also derive 12 features and demonstrate their utility in an ablation study. Logistic regression performed best on the test data, although differences between models were not always signiﬁcant. The results match the accuracy of state-of-the-art in comparable sports, such as tennis.
