## Abstract
It is important to evaluate the slope ecological restoration effect for diagnosing the slope restoration state in time. Several soft computing methods require experts to determine the index weight, which will affect the rationality of the evaluation results. Moreover, they are all static evaluation methods and cannot reflect the time effect of restoration. Therefore, a dynamic evaluation method has been proposed without determining the index weight based on Cosine Similarity and Markov Chain. Several cases were applied to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results presented that the results of this method are more consistent with the actual situations and can reflect the variability of the restoration effect. Finally, the sensitivity of indexes under different ecological restoration methods was analyzed. The results show that the core link of the restoration method was consistent with the sensitivity result. The proposed method provides a basis for optimizing the restoration methods.
