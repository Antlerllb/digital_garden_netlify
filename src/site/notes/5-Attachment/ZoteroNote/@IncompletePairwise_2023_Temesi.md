## Abstract
The method of pairwise comparisons is frequently applied for ranking purposes. This article aims to rank top women tennis players based on their win/lose ratios. Incomplete pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) were constructed from data obtained from the WTA (Women’s Tennis Association) homepage. The database contains head-to-head results from the period between 1973 and 2022 for 28 players who had the position No. 1 in the official rankings of WTA. The weight vector was calculated from the incomplete PCM with the logarithmic least squares method and the eigenvector method. The results are not surprising: Serena Williams, Steffi Graf, and Martina Navratilova stand in the first three positions, and Martina Hingis, Kim Clijsters, and Justine Henin follow them. We also tested the frequently used probability-based Bradley-Terry method and found high rank-correlation values. Using graph representations, the results gave us a deeper insight into the properties of incomplete PCMs. Special attention was given to the nontransitive triads. A data modification was necessary to remove ties in order to apply the commonly used tests. The results indicate that ordinally nontransitive triads are not significant in the data we analysed.
