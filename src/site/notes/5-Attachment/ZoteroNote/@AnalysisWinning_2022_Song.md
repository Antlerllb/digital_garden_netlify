## Abstract
The success or failure of badminton competition often depends on the training level of technical, physical, tactical, and psychological quality, as well as the competitive ability to comprehensively use these factors in the competition. Aiming at the improvement of the BP neural network algorithm, the improved BP neural network algorithm is used to analyze the multidimensional attributes of the collected data, and the simulation experiment is carried out to find out our competitive advantages and disadvantages. This paper presents a statistical study on the change of service area, the application of service receiving technology, and the treatment of the third stroke technology in the badminton competition. The innovative contribution of this paper is to explore the differences of double service decision-making of badminton at different levels and form a theoretical mechanism analysis system. The research shows that the relationship between active and passive attack and hitting quality has been dealt with in the game. In training, mastering the basic technical movements of badminton is conducive to improving the technical level of badminton.
