## Abstract
Sports data visualization can be a useful tool for analyzing or presenting sports data. In this paper, we present a new technique for visualizing tennis match data. It is designed as a supplement to online live streaming or live blogging of tennis matches. It can retrieve data directly from a tennis match live blogging web site and display 2D interactive view of match statistics. Therefore, it can be easily integrated with the current live blogging platforms used by many news organizations. The visualization addresses the limitations of the current live coverage of tennis matches by providing a quick overview and also a great amount of details on demand. The visualization is designed primarily for general public, but serious fans or tennis experts can also use this visualization for analyzing match statistics. We demonstrate this visualization technique with the example of 2015 French Open Ô¨Ånal match.
