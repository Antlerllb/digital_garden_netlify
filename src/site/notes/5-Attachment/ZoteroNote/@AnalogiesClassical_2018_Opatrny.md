## 1.2 Abstract
We show that the classical model of Euler top (freely rotating, generally asymmetric rigid body), possibly supplemented with a rotor, corresponds to a generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model describing phenomena of various branches of quantum physics. Classical effects such as free precession of a symmetric top, Feynman’s wobbling plate, tennis-racket instability and the Dzhanibekov effect, attitude control of satellites by momentum wheels, or twisting somersault dynamics, have their counterparts in quantum effects that include spin squeezing by one-axis twisting and two-axis countertwisting, transitions between the Josephson and Rabi regimes of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential, and other quantum critical phenomena. The parallels enable us to expand the range of explored quantum phase transitions in the generalized LMG model, as well as to present a classical analogy of the recently proposed LMG Floquet time crystal.
