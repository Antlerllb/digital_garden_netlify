## Abstract
Kinesio taping (KT) is widely used in sports for performance improvement and injury prevention. However, little is known of the behavior of the muscle region beneath the KT with movement, particularly when the muscle is fatigued. Accordingly, this study investigated the changes in the medial gastrocnemius muscle architecture and fascia thickness when using KT during maximum isometric plantar flexion (MVIC) and badminton lunges following heel rise exercises performed to exhaustion. Eleven healthy collegiate badminton players (4 males and 7 females) were recruited. All of the participants performed two tasks (MVIC and badminton lunge) with a randomized sequence of no taping, KT and sham taping and repeated following exhaustive repetitive heel rise exercise. In the MVIC task, the fascia thickness with the medial gastrocnemius muscle at rest significantly decreased following fatigue induction both without taping and with KT and sham taping (p = 0.036, p = 0.028 and p = 0.025, respectively). In the lunge task, the fascia thickness reduced after fatigue induction in the no taping and sham taping trials; however, no significant change in the fascia thickness occurred in the KT trials. Overall, the results indicate that KT provides a better effect during dynamic movement than in isometric contraction.
