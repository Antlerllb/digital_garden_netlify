## Abstract
The PHYAFB database is a valuable resource for studying the physiological demands of female amateur basketball players during high-stress official games. It contains heart rate data from ten players aged 18 to 26, collected during ten crucial relegation phase matches, with 348,232 HR samples in CSV and Excel formats for easy access and analysis. The database includes Python source code for initial examination. The primary aim of the PHYAFB database is to provide a useful reference for other teams facing similar situations. Furthermore, the database represents a unique and valuable resource for sports scientists, coaches, and trainers seeking to comprehend the physiological demands of female basketball players during official competitions. Through the analysis of heart rate data, coaches and trainers can identify the intensity and duration of physical activity during games, enabling the development of more effective training programs. Additionally, the database can be used to compare the physiological demands placed on male and female basketball players or to investigate the impact of different game strategies on player performance.
