## Abstract
This study aimed to examine the effect of time of day (TOD) on the acquisition of basketball game actions from dynamic and static visualizations in physical education students (novice practitioners). Participants were quasi-randomly assigned to three treatments (static pictures, enriched static-pictures, or video). Morning and late-afternoon sessions were conducted, involving study phases and immediate-recall tests [game comprehension (GC) test and game performance (GP) test]. Oral temperature (OT) and mood states (MS) were also measured. Compared to the morning, the results revealed that afternoon resulted in higher OT, higher negative MS (e.g., anxiety and fatigue), and lower positive MS (i.e., vigor) in all experimental conditions. Moreover, the results showed that: (a) GC and GP decreased throughout the day (regardless of treatments), (b) GC and GP were better with enriched static-pictures (with arrows) than with static pictures, at both TOD, and (c) the video resulted in better GC and GP than the two static presentations, at both TOD. This study (a) highlights the morning's superiority in the acquisition of motor skills from dynamic and static visualizations, due to mood disturbances and lower arousal levels, and (b) encourages basketball teachers to use video modeling by experts, particularly in the morning, for explaining tactical skills.
